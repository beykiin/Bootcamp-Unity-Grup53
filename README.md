    <h3>GAME DESCRIPTION:</h3>
    <p>Soul Harmonizer is a 3D action-adventure game full of emotional exploration that takes players on the adventure of an amnesiac main character. The game begins with the main character opening his eyes in a forest. The character reinvents himself and improves his abilities through the various emotions he discovers over time.</p>
    <img height="50">
    <div align="start"><b>Emotional Explorations and Skill Development:</b> 
    The main character explores emotions such as anger, compassion, and fear. For example, he strengthens his combat abilities by controlling his anger, or uses his compassion to gain forest animals as pets.</div>
    <div align="start"><b>Nature and Forest Themed Locations:</b> 
    Players adventure in a world filled with vast and detailed forests to explore. A dynamic environment is presented; Day and night cycles add depth to the game.</div>
    <div align="start"><b>Enhanced Storytelling:</b> 
    The game offers an in-depth story that tells the character's journey to recall his past and memory. As we watch the main character grow emotionally and mentally, players go on an emotional journey with him.</div>
    <div align="start"><b>Strategic Combat and Puzzle Solving:</b> 
    In addition to improving combat abilities, the game also encourages puzzle solving and strategic thinking. It offers a dynamic combat system where each emotion is integrated with a different usage style and game mechanics.</div>

    <h3>GAME FEATURES:</h3>
    <h4>FEAR:</h4>
    <div align="start">
        <b>Effect Mechanics:</b>
    When encountering wild animals in the forest or in dark environments, the fear bar appears and increases over time.
    </div>
    <div align="start">
        <b>Result:</b>
    As the fear level increases, the character's reaction slows down and certain abilities are affected.
    </div>
    <h4>ANGER:</h4>
    <div><b>Effect Mechanics:</b>
    Increases enemy damage by 50% for 15 seconds.</div>
    <div><b>Results:</b>
    As the fear level increases, the character's reaction slows down and certain abilities are affected.</div>
    <h4>COMPASION AND DEVOTION:</h4>
    <div><b>Effect Mechanics:</b>
    Can form an alliance with an encountered NPC or tame animals in the forest by feeding them.</div>
    <div> <b>Conclusion:</b>
    Tamed animals can help the character or offer special abilities.</div>
    <h4>SADNESS:</h4>
    <div><b>Effect Mechanics:</b>
     When an ally or pet is lost, the character takes -10 damage.</div>
    <div> <b>Results:</b>
    After each experience of sadness, the effect diminishes and the character gains resilience and becomes less susceptible to future losses.</div>
    <h4>BRAVERY:</h4>
    <div><b>Effect Mechanics:</b>
     As the combats are won, the ability to control the emotion of fear increases and the fear bar begins to fill more slowly.</div>
    <div> <b>Results:</b>
    Courage reduces the character's fear level and makes him less affected by making him more successful in battles.
These emotions and abilities increase the depth of the game, make the player feel the emotional and mental development of the character, and emphasize the importance of in-game decisions and strategies.</div>

### Development Process
Since each team member will take part in every step of product development and other steps, we did not need to separate them into teams.

- **Process of Determining Character Game Name and Team Names**
- We decided to go through a process that is democratic and supports voting integrity.

- Problems and obstacles encountered

- Due to the low motivation of the team at the beginning due to meeting and other stressful factors (final period, holidays, etc.), there was a general period of communication and indecision within the team. At this point, sincerely expressing expectations and sensitivities moved the team to a place where they trust and support each other.

### Notes and Additional Information

- All tasks and progress will be tracked on the [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/xrTqoIbq/ATTI4f8740de48680f66f6c977fad6bb6cdd8AB256ED/epic-minds)
- Each sprint will be uploaded at least one day before the sprint date and we will have a wider time frame to talk about it.

## Meeting Agenda
First sprint and game draft

1. **Sprint Goals**
   - Completing character selection
   - Writing basic movement codes
   - The game content was discussed and the game story and general content were decided.

2. **Collecting Feedback**
   - Self-evaluations of team members
   - What can be done to make up for the past three weeks?

3. **Deficiencies and Areas for Improvement**
   - Using icebreaker content for team motivation

# Sprint Retrospective

- **Good Parts:**
  - Increased communication and trust between team members
  - Sprint goals were largely completed successfully.
  - Daily stand-up meetings were productive and problems were resolved quickly.
  - Making assignments to the right members is an indication that the process will accelerate and progress better.
  - The positive aspects of collaboration and communication within the team were very beneficial to the content.

- **Bad Parts:**
  - The slow progress of the process until a certain date.
  - Small deadlines are exceeded, even if only slightly.

- **They will be improved:**
  - Duty periods need to be planned more realistically.
  
**Targets for the Next Sprint:**
- The development of the character in the game was discussed.
- The date has been set for level design, UI and AI add-ons.

## Sprint 2

**Estimated Points to be Completed in Sprint:** 8 points.
## Sprint End Evaluation

The target score we set for the sprint was 8 points. Factors affecting the scoring included the completion of level designs, the user interface, the writing of basic movement codes, team initiative, and communication points. Although there were communication issues within the team at the beginning of the sprint, the team’s coming together and closing the gap allowed us to finish the sprint with a full 8 points.


**Daily Scrum:** Daily Scrum meetings were held both on WhatsApp and Discord. Meetings were held twice a week on Discord. (A brief communication and accessibility issue was experienced within the team after the first sprint.)

**WhatsApp Group Logic:** The team was divided into two groups for level designs and coding. Level designs were to be completed and sent to the coders by a determined deadline. The coders would then write code based on these designs. Communication continued within the same group.
